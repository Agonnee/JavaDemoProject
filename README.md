# Learning Java first project

In order to learn Java, I'm starting with a simple backend API, while following a tutorial, set up to perform CRUD operations on a connected database.
I've learned that while syntax is a bit more cumbersome, there's not much difference to setting up an API between Springboot in Java and Flask in Python.

## This application

This application connects to a database (if you're trying to perform this locally you'll need to edit the application.properties in order to connect to a local database)
After connecting it creates two students and saves them to the database, from there I tested the various API endpoints with postman.

There's not a lot to it, but it's a start.

## This repo

Committing this, using the java.gitignore and maven.gitignore, hopefully those are adequate for not making this repo a mess.
